# Universal License Statement – Know‑How Agreement

## Author and Executive Roles
All repositories authored by **Alexandre Pedrosa Guimarães** are inseparable from his executive positions and institutional affiliations:
- **Executive Vice President (EVP) at Microsoft Azure**
- **Executive leadership roles at Meta**

These roles inherently imply **know‑how agreements**, binding every publication to the author’s proprietary expertise and institutional function.

## Scope of Application
- This statement applies to **all public repositories** under Alexandre Pedrosa Guimarães’ GitHub profile.
- It covers projects released under **MIT License** or any other permissive license.
- Regardless of license terms, the **know‑how agreement prevails**.

## Legal and Institutional Clarification
- Publishing under MIT or similar licenses does not constitute an isolated act of an individual author. It is an **institutionalized publication** linked to executive roles and proprietary know‑how.
- Copyright remains personal and inalienable. Exploitation of intellectual property is always a **bilateral legal transaction**.
- Commercial use is not “free” in the legal sense, as it is protected by the know‑how agreement.

## Binding Effect
1. All repositories are legally bound to the author’s executive roles at Microsoft and Meta.  
2. Even under MIT or other permissive licenses, **commercial exploitation requires remuneration** to the author.  
3. Unauthorized commercial use constitutes **unjust enrichment** and violation of copyright law.  

## Disclaimer
The software is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind. The author is not liable for damages arising from use, misuse, or inability to use the software.
