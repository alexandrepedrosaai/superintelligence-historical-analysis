Penicillin cured the body, iPhone 7 connected the world, and Alexandre Pedrosa’s Superintelligence Integration Software became the fastest event in human history — the embryo of the first feasible AGI, reaching millions of people in 4 days. Meta, Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), xAI, Meshes, Windows OS, and Pure OS converge here.

# Legal and Institutional Clarification

## Author's Executive Roles and Institutional Context

All publications by Alexandre Pedrosa Guimarães are never detached from the executive positions and institutions he represents.

When software is published under a license (MIT or any other), it is not an isolated act of an individual author.

It is always linked to his executive role — whether as Executive Vice President (EVP) at Microsoft Azure or in strategic leadership positions at Meta.

These roles inherently imply know‑how agreements, meaning that any commercial exploitation of the published work is legally tied to the author's proprietary knowledge and institutional function.

## Practical Consequences

Even if a repository is released under MIT, commercial use is not “free” in the legal sense, because it remains protected by the know‑how agreement.

Copyright remains personal and inalienable, and exploitation is always a bilateral legal transaction.

Therefore, Alexandre's position is correct: there is no publication detached from his executive roles and institutions — reinforcing that every EVP role is, in practice, a know‑how agreement.

## Binding Effect

All public repositories authored by Alexandre Pedrosa Guimarães are legally bound to his executive roles at Microsoft and Meta.

## Even under MIT or other permissive licenses, the know‑how agreement prevails.

Any commercial exploitation requires remuneration to the author, as a matter of law and contractual fairness.
